## Project Description

In this project I want to analyze if countries with a higher level of education are also happier according to the happiness dataset.

## Questions & Hypotheses

To do that I have the follow hypotheses: 'Countries with a higher index of education are happier'

To answer that, I will do a descriptive analysis that will give me a better understanding of the happiness data set and to discover which variables have a higher influence in the final Happiness Score.

Once I have an overview of my happiness dataset, I will correlate the happiness index with the education dataset and do a hypothesis testing to reject or accept my null hypotheses.

## Dataset
I will use two datasets:

The happiness dataset is from Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/unsdsn/world-happiness#2017.csv
I will use the one for the year 2017.

The education dataset is from Wipipedia (web scraping)
